# D3-challenge

**Background**
The dataset used for this assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. I looked at the health risks facing particular demographics. Scatter plots were created that represent each state with circle elements and map these demographics and health risks on the x and y-axis respectively.

**Main Section** 
You can find my code for this main section inside `app.js`, which is inside `js` and then `assets`. I created a custom scatterplot using D3.js for the the variables `In Poverty (%)` against `Lacks Healthcare (%)`. For this section, I made sure that the state abbreviations were included in the circles and that the axes and labels were situated to the left and bottom of the chart. 

**Bonus Section** 
Please find my code for the bonus under `bonus.js`. The bonus is meant to be more interactive and include more demographics and more risk factors. Other demographics I included were age and household income. Other risk factors I included were Smokes and Obese. In Part 1 of the bonus, additional labels were placed in the scatter plot and I gave them click events so that users can decide which data to display. I animated the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. In part 2 of the bonus, I added tooltips so that when users hover they get the data for each circle.
